### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    This is an analysis of the Sales performance of a Retail Store. It is done by analyzing data 
    using Pivot table from Capstone Sales Dataset. Also, different queries were executed from 
    the database using SQL and thereafter,imported into PowerBI where the actual analysis was
    carried out in order to discover the key insights such as the top selling products,
    Regional performance and Monthly Sales trends.

  - For Data Cleaning
  - For Analyzing
  - For Data Visualization
- SQL : Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- PowerBI:
  - For Data Modelling
  - For Data Visualization
  - Creating Key Performance Indicators(KPIs)
  - Using DAX Function to perform basic measures
- Github for portfolio building.

 ### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
  In the initial of the Data cleaning and preparation, the following actions were performed;
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Data cleaning and formatting: Duplicate were removed from rows in Excel using the filter
function to search for those empty rows. Then, Remove Duplicate function is used to the remove duplicate.

###  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
 The goal of this analysis is to produce an interactive PowerBI dashboard that highlights the following findings; 
 1. Using Excel to Perform:
  - An initial exploratory of the Sales Data,using pivot tables to summarize;
    - Total Sales by Product
    - Total Sales by Region and
    - Total Sales by Month.
  - Using Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as:
    - Average Sales per product
    - Total Revenue by Region
  - Create any other interesting report.
2. Using SQL,write queries to extract key insight based on the follwing questions:
    - Retrieve the total sales for each product category
    - Find the number of Sales transaction in each Region
    - Find the highest-selling product by total sales values
    - Calulate total revenue per product
    - Calculate monthly Sales totals for the current year.
    - Find the Top 5 customers by total purchase amount
    - Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region
    - Identfy products with no sales in the last quarter
3. Using PowerBI: Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL.The dashboard should include
   - Sales Overview
   - Top-Performance products and
   - Regional breakdown.

### DATA VISUALIZATION
 The table was then imported into PowerBI desktop for analysis.I transformed the Data in Power Query,checked for 
   column quality,distribution, profile and Data types. Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at 
   a desired KPIs or metrics. which are:
  - Top-Selling Products
  - Regional Performance and
  - Monthly Sales Trends
