## LITA_CAPSTONE_SALES_PROJECT
    This is where i documented my first project while learning data analysis with the Incubator hub.
### PROJECT TITLE: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store. 
---
### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    This is an analysis of the Sales performance of a Retail Store. It is done by analyzing data 
    using Pivot table from Capstone Sales Dataset. Also, different queries were executed from the 
    database using SQL and thereafter,imported into PowerBI where the actual analysis was carried out    
    in order to discover the key insights such as the top selling products,Regional performance and 
    Monthly Sales trends.

### DATA SOURCES
    The Data used for this project work is gotten from LITA Incubator.The primary source 
    of the Data is Data CSV and it is an open source Data that can be freely downloaded
    from Kaggle or any other Data repository site
---
### TOOL USED
-Microsoft Excel :
  - For Data Cleaning
  - For Analyzing
  - For Data Visualization
- SQL : Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- PowerBI:
  - For Data Modelling
  - For Data Visualization
  - Creating Key Performance Indicators(KPIs)
  - Using DAX Function to perform basic measures
  - Github for portfolio building.
 ---
 ### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
  In the initial of the Data cleaning and preparation, the following actions were performed;
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Using Excel function to calculate the Total Sales on sales Data and also Average subcription duration on customer Data.
   - Data cleaning and formatting.

###  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
 The goal of this analysis is to produce an interactive PowerBI dashboard that highlights the following findings; 
 1. Using Excel to Perform:
  - An initial exploratory of the Sales Data,using pivot tables to summarize;
    - Total Sales by Product
    - Total Sales by Region and
    - Total Sales by Month.
  - Using Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as:
    - Average Sales per product
    - Total Revenue by Region
  - Create any other interesting report.
2. Using SQL,write queries to extract key insight based on the follwing questions:
    - Retrieve the total sales for each product category
    - Find the number of Sales transaction in each Region
    - Find the highest-selling product by total sales values
    - Calulate total revenue per product
    - Calculate monthly Sales totals for the current year.
    - Find the Top 5 customers by total purchase amount
    - Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region
    - Identfy products with no sales in the last quarter
3. Using PowerBI: Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL.The dashboard should include
   a Sales Overview,Top-Performance products and Regional breakdown.

### DATA ANALYSIS
 This is where i used pivot tables to calculate the Total Sales for each category of products, Region,Month and other interesting reports were created.

 The Sales table was imported into SQL Management Studio were some queries were executed in order to get some ananlysis.

The table was then imported into PowerBI desktop for analysis.I transformed the Data in Power Query,checked for column quality,distribution, profile and Data types.

  Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at a desired KPI or metrics. which are:
  - Top-Selling Products
  - Regional Performance 
  - Monthly Sales Trends and
  - insights Analysis

### DATA MODELLING
 Tables were automatically joined together by creating relationship with them, PowerBI does this intelligently.To get specific insights and 
information,i had to create other relationship and measures.
